The downloaded images are formatted such that each image from each of the coordinates is saved into a folder alongside its metadata (i.e. coordinates, date picture was taken, etc.).

The scripts in this section are to be used to preprocess all the data into a convenient format, where all the images are given unique IDs and all the metadata are put into a csv file and corresponded with the image IDs. All ID'ed images are grouped into a single folder.

Some scripts might contain functionality you wouldn't necessarily need. Use them at your own discretion. I hope the names I gave to the scripts are self-descriptive. All the scripts are in Jupyter notebook format.
